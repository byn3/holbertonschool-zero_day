# Schoolwork from the very first day at Holberton.  

Projects focused on setting up the environment with Vagrant, learning emacs, vim, and git. It was a long day. Some people had no coding experience and this definately was a huge wall. I had to teach them a lot of this.

### More specific READMEs located within each directory.  
There are questions I answered in each README, questions vary:  
Vagrant folder answers some very basic concept questions and some security related questions.  
Emacs folder has Richard Stallman info and basic commands.  
Vi has Bill Joy and basic commands. I use Vim.  
Git folder has basic commands and branching and merging.
