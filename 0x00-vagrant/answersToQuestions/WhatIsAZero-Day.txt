What is a zero-day?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing%29
Day zero is the day someone learns about the vulnerability in the system. 
So the fewer days since day zero, the higher the chance no fix or mitigation has been developed. 
And even after a fix is made, there is still a high probability of damage because not every user applied the fix.  
SEVERE THREAT.
