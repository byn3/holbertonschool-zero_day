What I should learn from this project,

What is a virtual machine
What is vagrant
Who wrote Vagrant
What is Ubuntu
What does Ubuntu mean
How to use VMs with Vagrant
What does the command uname do
What is a zero-day

The answer to these without using Google, to explain them, and OH MUH LARD. Stuff I am learning that is not part of those questions are emacs and vim. I chose wim. I have a bit of emacs knowledge but I will be going forward with Vim. Thanks Joma. Now, if I could stop procrastinating and just start the work instead of typing to myself. Man these command though. insert on fleek. THey wont let me use IDEs or atom. sad.
